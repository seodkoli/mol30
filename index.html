<h4>Wikipedia says this about Home inspection</h4>
<p class="mb-0"><p>A <b>home inspection</b> is a limited, non-invasive examination of the condition of a home, often in connection with the sale of that home. Home inspections are usually conducted by a <b>home inspector</b> who has the training and certifications to perform such inspections. The inspector prepares and delivers to the client a written report of findings. In general, home inspectors recommend that potential purchasers join them during their onsite visits to provide context for the comments in their written reports. The client then uses the knowledge gained to make informed decisions about their pending real estate purchase. The home inspector describes the condition of the home at the time of inspection but does not guarantee future condition, efficiency, or life expectancy of systems or components.</p>

<p>Sometimes confused with a real estate <a data-abc="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appraiser" title="Appraiser">appraiser</a>, a home inspector determines the condition of a structure, whereas an appraiser determines the value of a property. In the United States, although not all states or municipalities regulate home inspectors, there are various professional associations for home inspectors that provide education, training, and networking opportunities. A professional home inspection is an examination of the current condition of a house. It is not an inspection to verify compliance with appropriate codes; <a data-abc="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_inspection" title="Building inspection">building inspection</a> is a term often used for building code compliance inspections in the United States.

Home inspections identify problems but <a data-abc="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_diagnostics" title="Building diagnostics">building diagnostics</a> identifies solutions to the found problems and their predicted outcomes. A property inspection is a detailed visual documentation of a property&#39;s structures, design, and fixtures. Property Inspection provides a buyer, renter, or other information consumer with valuable insight into the property&#39;s conditions prior to purchase. House-hunting can be a difficult task especially when you can&#39;t seem to find one that you like. The best way to get things done is to ensure that there is a property inspection before buying a property.</p><br></p>
